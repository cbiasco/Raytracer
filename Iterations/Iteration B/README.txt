# Code by Caleb Biasco - biasc007
# for CSCI 5607, Fall Semester 2016

HOW TO COMPILE:
Extract the .tar.gz file, then navigate to the build directory. Run "cmake .." inside the build directory, then run "make -j" to actually compile the program.

HOW TO RUN:
Run "./raytracer <filename>" in the same directory as the program. The program only takes 1 argument, which is the correctly formatted input file for the 3D scene. If the input is correct, no errors will display on the command line and it will indicate an output file name.
